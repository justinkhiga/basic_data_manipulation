# basic_data_manipulation
THis is a portfolio project demonstrating some basic data manipulation/summarization and visualization.

I have also included some statistical descriptives, which can further be 
utilized for regression analysis.

Statistical coding is based off of class material from Dr. Jennifer Koran, Southern Illinois University.
